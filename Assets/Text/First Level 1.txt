Hi! I am an Info Box! <Press Enter>
I will help you in tough situations <Press Enter>
As you have already learned the controls, it is the time to learn about the hazards. <Press Enter>
In this game there are three main types of hazards. The first being spikes. <Press Enter> 
This is to teach you, that in high school you must be careful where and when you step, as there are many things that could cause you to fall or get hurt. <Press Enter>
The second are the moving platforms. Unlike normal platforms (where you can stand on it and it will transport you), these platforms slip right under your feet. <Press Enter>
This is to teach you, that in high school the floors our usually slippery (especially in winter), so if not careful, you might just slip and fall. <Press Enter>
Lastly, you have the bullies. Be careful and watch out for them, as they might be a bad influence. Of course it is better to stand up to them, but for now, it is best to avoid them. <Press Enter>
That's it. Off you go! And keep a look out for the IB Learner Profiles, they should be in a red box. <Press Enter>
